\section{Abelian extensions of $\mathbb{Q}(i)$}
\label{sec:abel-extens-Qi}

Let $k = \mathbb{Q}(i)$, so that $\mathfrak{o}_{k} = \mathbb{Z}[i]$.  In Section
\ref{sec:struct-ende-char-zero} we established that the elliptic curve $E$ given by
the equation
\begin{equation*}
  y^{2} = x^{3} + x
\end{equation*}
has complex multiplication by $\mathbb{Z}[i]$.  In particular, we know that $h_{k} =
1$ so $j(E)$ is rational (indeed, we have $j(E) = 1728$).
